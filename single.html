There's only one reason I would ever tell anyone my name. There's only one time I could... I don't want to go. Blimey, trying to make an Ood laugh... I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. New-new-Doctor. Don't you think she looks tired? I'm the Doctor, I can save the world with a kettle and some string! And look! I'm wearing a vegetable! I'll tell you what, then: don't...step on any butterflies. What have butterflies ever done to you?</p>

Am I rude? Rude and not ginger. Oh, yes. Harmless is just the word: that's why I like it! Doesn't kill, doesn't wound, doesn't maim. But I'll tell you what it does do: it is very good at opening doors! You can spend the rest of your life with me, but I can't spend the rest of mine with you. I have to live on. Alone. That's the curse of the Time Lords.</p>

I'd call you a genius, except I'm in the room. What? What?! WHAT?! Blimey, trying to make an Ood laugh... Don't you think she looks tired? There was a war. A Time War. The Last Great Time War. My people fought a race called the Daleks, for the sake of all creation. And they lost. We lost. Everyone lost. They're all gone now. My family. My friends. Even that sky.</p>

                        <p>I never know why. I only know who. I know. Dinosaurs! On a spaceship! There's something that doesn't make sense. Let's go and poke it with a stick. Come along, Pond! There are fixed points throughout time where things must stay exactly the way they are. This is not one of them. This is an opportunity! Whatever happens here will create its own timeline, its own reality, a temporal tipping point. The future revolves around you, here, now, so do good! I need...I need...I need... fish fingers and custard!</p>

                        <p>Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or, as I’ve always known him, Jeff. No. You're too short and bossy, and your nose is all funny. I once spent a hell of a long time trying to get a gobby Australian to Heathrow airport. Oh, I always rip out the last page of a book. Then it doesn't have to end. I hate endings! Brave heart, Clara. Look at me. No plans, no backup, no weapons worth a damn. Oh, and something else I don't have: anything to lose. So, if you're sitting up there with your silly little spaceships and your silly little guns and you've any plans on taking the Pandorica tonight; just remember who's standing in your way. Remember every black day I ever stopped you and then, and then, do the smart thing. Let somebody else try first.</p>

                        <p>Overconfidence, this, and a small screwdriver. I’m absolutely sorted. There are fixed points throughout time where things must stay exactly the way they are. This is not one of them. This is an opportunity! Whatever happens here will create its own timeline, its own reality, a temporal tipping point. The future revolves around you, here, now, so do good! No idea. Just do what I do: hold tight and pretend it's a plan. Brave heart, Clara. Usually called 'The Doctor.' Or 'The Caretaker.' Or 'Get off this planet.' Though, strictly speaking, that probably isn't a name.</p>

                        <p>I know. Dinosaurs! On a spaceship! Brave heart, Clara. There are fixed points throughout time where things must stay exactly the way they are. This is not one of them. This is an opportunity! Whatever happens here will create its own timeline, its own reality, a temporal tipping point. The future revolves around you, here, now, so do good! Yes, well, it's a brilliant noise. I love that noise. Goodbye, Clara. I once spent a hell of a long time trying to get a gobby Australian to Heathrow airport.</p>
